# Object-Oriented Programming (COS20007) Weekly Assignments - Swinburne University

This repository contains all my solutions for the **weekly assignments** in the **Object-Oriented Programming (COS20007)** unit at **Swinburne University**. It includes various exercises and projects that demonstrate the practical application of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and design patterns.

## Final Result: **97% (HD)**

I achieved a **final grade of 97%**, which corresponds to a **High Distinction (HD)** for the unit. This repository showcases my understanding and application of core OOP principles and demonstrates how I applied them to solve various real-world problems.

## Repository Contents

- **Weekly Assignment Solutions**: This folder contains the solutions to each weekly assignment that helped me build a strong foundation in object-oriented programming.
- **Final Custom Program**: A complete C# program that demonstrates advanced OOP principles using real-world design patterns.
- **Research Project**: This section includes my final research project exploring key concepts in object-oriented programming and their practical applications in software engineering.

## Final Projects

- [**SoNeat (Custom Program)**](https://github.com/minhan6559/SoNeat): This project is a C# application that was designed as a custom program to get HD. Link to the project [here](https://github.com/minhan6559/SoNeat)
  
- [**Object-Oriented Programming in PyTorch: A Deep Dive (Research Project)**](./Research%20Project/Object_Oriented_Programming_in_PyTorch__A_Deep_Dive.pdf): The research project covers an in-depth analysis of an OOP concept, exploring its application in the modern deep learning frameworks - Pytorch.

## Achievements

- **Highest Achiever Award**: Achieved a final grade of 97% for the Object-Oriented Programming unit at Swinburne University.
- **Best Project Award**: The final custom program was awarded the Best Project Award for its outstanding design and implementation.
